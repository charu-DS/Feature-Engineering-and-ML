Description about the problem:
We want to predict the price of pre-owned cars.
This is a real world problem for an e-commerce company who acts as mediator between parties interested in selling and buying pre-owned cars.
For that we want to develop an algorithm to predict the price of cars based on various attributes associated with cars.
So if the buyer comes and asks for a car at a much higher or lower rate, then they can correct according to the algorithm and both parties will be happy and it will lead to a better business.
